This thesis presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a new
domain--specific language embedded within Haskell for nested array computations
executed on graphics processing units. The design concentrates on providing a
high--level abstraction that composes computations that run efficiently
according to the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying hardware, without
forcing the programmer to recast their algorithm to fit within the architecture.

The final design \ldots\ and benchmarking shows that the goals of the design were
