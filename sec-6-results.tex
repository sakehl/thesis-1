\begin{itemize}
    \item performance \& analysis
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What is an optimisation? Describe the metrics considered.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item wall-clock time, parallel speedup??
          \item instruction count
          \item memory traffic (load/store/coalescing)
          \item memory size (heap, register count, shared memory)
          \item program size (number of parallel steps)
          \item code size (generated binary, compilation time c.f. code complexity)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item expressiveness / example programs
    \item difficulties
    \begin{itemize}
        \item code generation
        \item unintentional nesting
    \end{itemize}
