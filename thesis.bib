title = {{GPU Kernels as Data-Parallel Array Computations in Haskell}},
booktitle = {EPHAM '09: Workshop on Exploiting Parallelism using GPUs and other Hardware-Assisted Methods},
year = {2009},
annote = {This is Sean's work on embedding GPU array computations in Haskell, upon which I will base my research. This work is limited to flat data parallelism, and my goal is to extend this to support nested data parallelism, most likely via the flattening transformation introduced by NESL, and used in DPH. Includes various benchmarks comparing CPU and hand-written GPU implementations. At the time of writing, the system was not complete and some parts of the EDSL were implemented by hand. Presents a reasonable argument for embedding the GPU language in a purely functional language (namely, Haskell) -- stream processing languages based in traditional imperative languages force the developer to limit side effects themselves, whereas pure languages are by-default safe for parallel execution. Uses the Haskell type system to automatically enforce pure GPU kernels and limit the variety of array operations (flat, basic data types). Avoids the need to decompose programs/functions based on architectural constraints rather than standard software engineering considerations. The main limitation of the approach, which is at the same time a key strength, is the high-level nature of the language. While this makes it easy for developers to express their algorithms without being over-burdeneded with parallel implementation details, there is (at least currently) no fine-grain control available for things like data layout and use of the memory hierarchy. As memory bandwidth is usually a major bottleneck, this lack of control could limit the ability to optimise critical sections of an algorithm for best performance.}

They argue that the key to performance is through massive multithreading to saturate the large number of cores and hide memory access latency, which requires a balance between each thread's resource usage (registers \{\&} shared memory) and the number of simultaneously active threads (in total and per multiprocessor). Performance is also gained by reordering and coalescing off-chip memory access. The major principles they identify to be considered when when choosing code to be executed on the platform are: * leverage zero-overhead thread scheduling to hide memory latency * optimise use of on-chip memory to reduce bandwidth usage and redundant execution * group threads to avoid SIMD penalties and memory port/bank conflicts * there is no built-in global communication mechanism for all threads Related work section provides a good history of data-parallel and GPGPU programming models. Detailed running example of optimising matrix-matrix multiplication, then present \{\&} discuss the results of a number of other applications. Several interesting insights to the complexity of optimisation for the platform * small changes have multiplicative resource usage effects (due to the large number of threads), which can cause fewer thread blocks to be simultaneously executed. * relatively easy to be "trapped" in a local maximum when hand optimising code -- may need to try widely varying configurations to find satisfactory performance. * the primary concern is often managing global memory latency, as global memory bandwidth can limit the throughput of the system}

annote = {Scout is designed as a portable language for programming GPUs in the stream processing model (flat data-parallel, SPMD), that includes constructs for both general-purpose computation as well as data visualisation. This strategy hides the nuances of both the underlying hardware and supporting graphics layer, providing users the ability to simultaneously process and interact with data from a single unified language. Two examples of combined combination/visualisation are provided, which show the programming model to be straight-forward and concise. No comparisons or benchmarks to hand-optimised code are provided. Good summary of related work, both for data-parallel languages and visualisation, including comparisons to the various applicable components of Scout. No competing compute+visualise system was mentioned, so seems to be a fairly unique contribution. Clear on how their ideas derive from or extend related works. Possibly applicable to my work, there is some discussion of how the Scout language is transformed into an intermediate representation, which is analysed for control/data flow in a directed graph / single static assignment, to locate {\&} combine parallel regions, and reduce memory traffic between CPU and GPU. They are also aiming at a slightly higher level of abstraction (as I also will be) than most GPU programming languages, which focus on kernel writing. The core system seems to be base on the old pre-CUDA graphics-API paradigm, so lacks support for new features such as data scatter. The authors mention this may be investigated in the future (although that could make the platform vendor-specific).}

Failure of HPF, an early attempt at a truly parallel language that pushed too far, too soon. CAF, UPC and Titanium, which provide only minimal extensions to their base languages. ZPL, which demonstrated a high-level approach to array operations (s.c. NESL?). Provides two fairly detailed examples of parallel expression in these languages with a finite difference problem (PDE: data decomposition), and Hartree-Fock algorithm (task parallelism of distributed data). Describes different features the languages support to express these types of parallelism easily. Provides a decent outline of these languages.

Defines parallel programming productivity as a combination of performance, programmability, portability and robustness. Describes their work on the language Chapel, which strives to impact positively in all of these areas. Argues that as many data-parallel languages require programmers to write in a SPMD style, makes it difficult to express nested data or data/task parallelism. Such fragmented programming models make it fairly easy to understand and reason about, but require programmers to express algorithms on a task-by-task basis, explicitly decomposing data structures and control flow into per-task chunks. Rather negative of SPMD. Expounds the global programming model, expressing algorithms and data structures as a whole without needing to specify the mapping onto threads (or specifying only when necessary for performance-critical sections). Supports many other data/task parallelism initiatives.}

A good argument for the applicability of data parallelism: intuition will initially lead to the assumption that data parallel algorithms are suitable only for very regular calculations in simulation and search. The paper argues that this is in fact an appropriate style whenever the amount of data to be operated upon is very large -- if the number of lines of code is fixed and the amount of data is allowed to grow arbitrarily, the ratio of code to data will necessarily approach zero. The parallelism to be gained by concurrently operating on multiple data elements will therefore be greater than the parallelism to be gained by concurrently executing lines of code. * parallel combinator reduction (can be used to simulate control parallelism) * all partial sums (prefix-scan) * count/enumerate active processors (filter?) * radix sort * string parsing * find the end of a linked list (seems to require that each element of the linked list is associated with a processor, and then all processors work together to find the end of the list in O(n log n) time) * all partial sums of a linked list * matching up elements of two linked lists (?) * region labeling (CC) * some discussion of nested data parallelism A seminal paper for data parallel computing. Possibly useful to my work for some fundamental ideas for designing algorithms. Examples focus on vector computers, but the segmented/prefix-scan is still valid today.}

Main differences to OpenMP: - the threading hierarchy supported by hiCUDA is more complicated than the flat threading hierarchy supported by OMP - The GPU memory hierarchy (and supported access) is more complicated than the shared memory model of OMP - OMP supports a more general execution model than the SPMD model supported by hi/CUDA, so many OMP directives are not supported Disadvantages: - By using annotations, thread and data decomposition seems to be statically bound, whereas a native CUDA program can specify these at runtime (although in practice this may be uncommon) - It is sometimes required to make structural changes to the sequential code before applying the directives. For example, privatisation of array variables, loop interchange and unrolling. Authors believe that these (coupled with a few other optimisations) could lead to an automatically parallelising compiler. In reality, this is several rather large steps away...}

The paper itself describes a source-to-source translation of OpenMP parallel constructs to CUDA kernels. This seems to be done fairly well in general. There is some effort spent discussing difficulties with kernel identification that seem a little redundant. Towards the end of this section it is mentioned off-hand that kernels might also be identified in a bottom-up fashion, but this is not explored. Describes and implement two techniques to improve global memory access coalescing, and demonstrate that these both work well. These are similar to transformations common in compilers for vector processors. No described use of GPU streaming multiprocessor shared memory, although it is mentioned in passing as a possible target for caching. Section 5, performance evaluation: "some advanced compiler optimisations [...] were applied manually", no details. Seems a rather large omission when providing performance metrics for an "automated" system. Also no comparison between hand-written CUDA code (with and/or without use of shared memory), or CPU-GPU transfer statistics.}

Ideally, a parallel algorithm has the same work complexity as a serial algorithm, however this is not possible even in theory for some algorithms, even if the step complexity is lower. Some problems are considered intrinsically serial, such as depth-first tree labeling.}

Data parallelism restricts parallelism to the application of a single function to all elements of a collective structure.

The programming model is also closer to sequential programming, and arguably easier to understand. Extends NESL (Blelloch et. al.) to support user-defined recursive and sum types, and also benefits from other features of Haskell (I/O, type system, standardised language, etc...) Parallel and sequential structures are distinguished through the type system.}

These operations are visible to the compiler, which can then apply automatic transformation rules to minimise communication and make better use of the memory hierarchy. The contribution is to enable the automatic use of these optimisations for the parallel implementation of aggregrate structures in collection-oriented languages (the optimisations themselves are not new).

annote = {Presents a static, analytical performance model for GPUs, capturing full system complexity and demonstrating high accuracy in predicting the performance trend of implementations. In cases where it cannot determine the precise performance for a kernel, it provides lower and upper bounds. Intended to be used as part of an automatically optimising compiler, to model performance and prune the search space for kernel optimisations. Not directly related to my work, but could be of interesting use (as a toolkit).}
