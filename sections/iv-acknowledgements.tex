\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\markboth{Acknowledgements}{}

\begin{center}

My supervisors Manuel and Gabi, for their (usually) gentle guidance, and for
allowing me the opportunity and (most importantly) the time to explore possibilities.
\\\qquad

My friends and family, for putting up with me when things got out of hand\\
(as they inevitably do).
\\\qquad

And of course, to Josephine, for her unwavering support and encouragement.

\end{center}
