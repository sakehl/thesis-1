\epigraph{At the beginning of a novel, a writer needs confidence, but after that
what's required is persistence. These traits sound similar. They aren't.
Confidence is what politicians, seducers and currency speculators have, but
persistence is a quality found in termites. It's the blind drive to keep on
working that persists after confidence breaks down.}%
