% Background / Literature Review
%
% The literature review is an organisational pattern that combines both summary
% and synthesis. It may give a new interpretation of old material, combine old
% and new interpretations, or trace the intellectual progression of a field. It
% should be organised around ideas, not expand each source individually.
%
% - What themes and issues connect the sources together?
% - What solutions are present, which aspects are missing?
% - What is the trend in the field?

Modern microprocessor technology is constructed from millions of interconnected
switching devices, called transistors. As process technology advances, these
transistors, and the interconnections between them, can be fabricated in a
smaller area. The challenge for microprocessor architects is to translate this
increase in resources into an increase in performance.

Computers are no longer getting faster; instead, we will be offered computers
containing more and more CPUs, each of which is individually no faster than
those of the previous generation. As the number of CPUs increases, it will
become increasingly difficult for programmers to
